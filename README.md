## Introduction

[Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) is a specification for light, logic-less templates. 

This project aims to deliver a set of base classes and example templates that can be used to build websites using the TourCMS API and Mustache templating system, building on the excellent [mustache.php](https://github.com/bobthecow/mustache.php).

## Installation

1. Download / clone to a directory on your webserver

2. Rename `inc/config-example.php` to `inc/config.php`

3. Edit `inc/config.php` and enter your TourCMS API credentials

4. Fire up a browser and point it at `product-list.php`

## Configuration

### Pretty URLs

Enabling pretty URLs is a two step process:

1. Rename `.htaccess-example` to `.htaccess`

2. ???

## Known issues

None, although this is very early code so beware!
