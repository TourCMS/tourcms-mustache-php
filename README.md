# tourcms-mustache-php

## Introduction

[Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) is a specification for light, logic-less templates. 

This project aims to deliver a set of base classes and example templates that can be used to build websites using the TourCMS API and Mustache templating system, building on the excellent bobthecow/mustache.php.

## Installation

1. Download / clone to a directory on your webserver

2. Rename inc/config-example.php to inc/config.php

3. Edit inc/config.php and enter your TourCMS API credentials

4. Fire up a browser and point it at product-list.php

5. [Optional] Rename .htaccess-example to .htaccess to enable pretty-er urls

## Known issues

None, although this is very early code so beware!
